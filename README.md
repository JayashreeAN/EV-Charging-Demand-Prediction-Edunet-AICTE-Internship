# EV Charging Demand Prediction
This project aims to predict the demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging using machine learning.  
It was created as part of the Edunet-AICTE Internship Program.

## What This Project Does
- Loads a raw EV charging dataset
- Cleans and preprocesses the data
- Performs data analysis and visualization
- Builds a Random Forest model to predict EV charging demand
- Saves the trained model for future use

## Files Included
- `Dataset.csv` – Original raw data
- `EV_Charging_Demand_Prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook with full code
- `Preprocessed_EV_data.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for model training
- `forecasting_ev_model.pkl` – Saved machine learning model (ready for predictions)

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- joblib
